# my_first_react_app
This is my very first attempt on React and building an app with the components structure that React provides.

<h1>My first React app</h1>

<p>This app is configured using npm create-react-app. This has provided my project with all the necessary configuration to get started using React.</p>

<p>This project is created by me to get a better understanding of React and how it works when combining different components and working with props. In this first version I have only worked with a static enviroment. </p>
